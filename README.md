## Install
You can download latest [release](https://github.com/dracula/foot/releases).

Use the ini file and merge the [color] section with your existing file.

If your file is 'clean' or just original.
I'd recommend just to use the patching system described in INSTALL.md.
 
Instructions can be found in the [INSTALL.md](https://github.com.com/foot/blob/master/README.md).
